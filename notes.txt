OpenShift Build Configuration (BuildConfig):
In OpenShift, you need to define a BuildConfig object to configure the S2I build process.
This file specifies details such as the source repository, build strategy (S2I), builder image, 
context directory (where the Dockerfile is located), and any necessary build environment variables.

Deployment Configuration (DeploymentConfig or Kubernetes Deployment):
After the S2I build completes, you need a Deployment Configuration or Kubernetes Deployment object to define how 
the built image will be deployed and run in the cluster. This includes details such as the container image, 
environment variables, ports, replicas, and other deployment settings.

Service (Optional):
If your application requires network access or needs to be exposed externally, 
you may need to define a Service object. The Service specifies a stable network endpoint (IP and port) 
for accessing your application within the cluster.

Route (In OpenShift):
In OpenShift, if you want to expose your application to the outside world, you can use a Route object. 
The Route sets up a public domain name (URL) and routes incoming traffic to your application's Service.
